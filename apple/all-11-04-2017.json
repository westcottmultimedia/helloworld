Moving away from the New Wave flirtations of 2012\u2019s chart-topping <i>Unorthodox Jukebox<\/i>, the singer/songwriter/musician fills <i>24K Magic<\/i> with the feel-good vibes of \u201880s and \u201890s R&amp;B. With the champagne-popping title track, epic slow jams (\u201cVersace on the Floor\u201d), and undeniable bops (\u201cThat\u2019s What I Like\u201d), Mars is a master of infectious pop. In other words, it\u2019s <i>Uptown Funk, The Album<\/i>: a party-starting, jam-packed good time and further proof that Mars is at the top of his game.","short":"The superstar returns with an album of big, bold retro R&amp;B."}}}]}]}}
